FINISHED - Make a translation of the content section 1
FINISHED - Optional: Separate Text into 2-3 sentences and ask Artic to translate them separately. Maybe this will improve the translation quality.
- Optional: Ask Artic to improve its own translation bevor giving it to the user.
- Summarize (This classic must be included)
- Combine Knowledge
- Load article in different languages and ask Artic to create a unified version

- Show Differences
- Load arcticles and ask Artic to point out the difference between all that versions.

- Optional: Instead using a fixed localization for the app, use the LLM to translate labels on demand and store them in cache.
Meaning that we will never again have lost translation strings when a thing in the app has changes.
Or Maybe a mixed use case, where it only translates and cache strings in the app not existing in the pre-defined localization files.
